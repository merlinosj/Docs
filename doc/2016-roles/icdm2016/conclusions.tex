\section{Concluding remarks}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper we propose a new type of role discovery optimization problem.  We
propose that the vertices should have the same role if their profiles, role
counts of neighbors, are similar.

From technical point, our method is different than feature-based techniques
because our features are in fact roles of neighbors. Hence, a two-step
approach---($i$) construct features and ($ii$) cluster roles from
features---does not work. This intricate dependency makes the optimization
problem difficult: we show that the problem is \np-hard, and cannot be even approximated if we fix the
centroids for the roles.

On the positive side we show that we can discover the perfect, zero-cost,
solution with minimal number of roles efficiently in polynomial time. When the
number of roles is fixed, we propose two simple natural heuristics: iterative
optimization and a hill-climbing algorithm.

Interestingly enough, we do not directly use any network-based feature when
comparing vertices. Instead, we are only interested in role counts. Our logic
is that fundamentally different ego-networks for vertices, say, $u$ and $v$,
should result in different role counts which should imply that $u$ and $v$ are
different. Nevertheless, combining our approach with other feature-based role
discovery methods provides a potentially fruitful direction for future work.
